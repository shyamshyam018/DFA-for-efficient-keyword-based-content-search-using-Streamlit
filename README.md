# 📚 EduKeySearch – DFA-Optimized Keyword Search Engine for ITS

EduKeySearch is a mini project that showcases an **efficient keyword-based content search system** using **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**. It is tailored for **Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS)** to help learners quickly find educational resources by entering simple search terms.

## 💡 About the Project

In modern digital education platforms, learners often struggle to find the exact content due to poor search mechanisms. EduKeySearch addresses this issue with a DFA-based search engine that ensures **fast**, **precise**, and **case-insensitive** keyword matching.

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ DFA-based pattern matcher for efficient keyword search  
- 🖼️ Beautiful course cards with images and titles  
- 🧠 Real-time filtering of educational content  
- 🧭 Sidebar navigation between **Home** and **Search**  
- 📱 Responsive layout built using **Streamlit**

## ⚙️ How DFA Works in This Project

- A **Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)** is constructed for every keyword entered by the user.
- This DFA is used to **match substrings** inside course titles quickly.
- Unlike regular Python `in` or regex, DFA matching is optimized to process text in **O(n)** time with **constant-time transitions**, ideal for real-time filtering.
